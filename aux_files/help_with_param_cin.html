<p>CNApp applies a <b>re-segmentation</b> approach aiming at correcting potential background noise and amplitude divergence due to technical variability. Parameters for re-segmentation are:

<ul>
<li>Minimum segment length [100000 bp]:<br>minimum length of a copy-number segment to be included in the analysis. Segments below this value will be automatically discarded</li>
<li>Maximum distance between segments [1000000 bp]:<br>maximum distance allowed between segments to be merged. Segments above this value will not be merged even accomplishing the remaining required parameters</li>
<li>Maximum amplitude (<i>seg.mean</i>) deviation between segments [0.16]:<br>maximum difference allowed in seg.mean values between adjacent segments</li>
<li>Minimum amplitude (<i>seg.mean</i>) deviation from segment to zero [0.16]:<br>segments must have <i>seg.mean</i> values higher than 0.16 or lower than -0.16 to be considered for re-segmentation, otherwise, they will be re-segmented to 0 baseline.</li>
<li>Maximum BAF deviation between segments [0.1]:<br>maximum deviation allowed in BAF values between adjacent segments</li>
</ul>

Users can customize these parameters (<i>Advanced</i> option) or use the default ones.
<br>
<br>
Re-segmentation step can be skipped, in wich case CNA scores will be computed considering segments from the input file.</p>

<p><b>CNA Scores</b> (i.e. Broad, Focal and Global [<i>BCS</i>, <i>FCS</i> and <i>GCS</i>, respectively]) are computed through copy number events <u>classification and weigth</u>, according to customizable CNA level thresholds (see our manuscript <a href="#"><u><i>Franch-Exp√≥sito et al., 2018</i></u></a> for mor details).
<br>
<br>
Default thresholds for CNA calling are:

<p><u>CNAs classification</u> is performed by applying whole-chromosome and chromosome arm coverage cutoffs. Default cutoffs are as follows and can be changed by the user:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimal coverage for chromosomal CNAs [0.9]:<br>considering the relative length of a segment to the whole-chromosome, the segment will be tagged as chromosomal if covers more than 90% of the chromosome</li>
<li>Minimal coverage for arm-level events [0.5]:<br>considering the relative length of a segment to a chromosome-arm, the segment will be tagged as arm-level if covers  more than 50% of the arm</li>
</ul>
