<b><i>Classifier model</i></b> section applies <i>randomForest</i> R package to assess potential for selected variables from user to work as a classifier features to discriminate groups defined by other user annotation variables. To do that, machine learning-based prediction models are computed and global classification accuracy for variables is specified (see our manuscript <a href="#"><u><i>Franch-Exp√≥sito et al., 2018</i></u></a> for mor details).

<br>

<p>If <i>Re-Seg & Score</i> and/or <i>Region profile</i> have been run, annotation features from these section can be loaded (i.e. CNA Scores and genomic regions).</p>
 
<br>

<p>In order for models to work, <u>variable to define groups</u> in user dataset and <u>varible to classify</u> those groups must be specified. Sub-tags from group variable can be selected to further restrict sample groups definition.</p>
