<p>
The genomic region profiling generates genome-wide profiles by transforming using segmented data into genome region profiles defined by a user-selected windows (i.e., chromosome arms, half-arms, cytobands, sub-cytobands or 40-1 Mb windows). Length-relative means are computed for each window by considering amplitude values from those segments included in the specific window (see our manuscript <a href="#"><u><i>Franch-Exp√≥sito et al., 2018</i></u></a> for mor details).</p>

<p>When <i>Re-Seg & Score</i> section has been run, options to use resources from that sections are available:

<ul>
<li>Use <i>new segments</i>:<br>Re-segmented data (or not, if skipped) can be selected for analysis in this section</li>
<li>Choose CNAs according to their classification:<br>taking advantage of CNA classification from <i>Re-Seg & Score</i>, all, only broad, or only focal events can be selected (i.e. recommended to selected focal events if the aim of study are focal alterations regions and frequencies)</li>
<li>Add CNA scores as annotation variables:<br>CNA Scores (i.e. BCS, FCS and GCS [see <i>Re-Seg & Score</i> section]) can be loaded as annotation tracks in this section</li>
</ul>
